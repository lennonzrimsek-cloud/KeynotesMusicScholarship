<h2 class="h2-styled">Keynotes Music Competition 2025</h2>
<p class="p-styled">A magnificent display of talent, discipline and passion were the highlights of this year’s music competition on May 10, 2025.  The competition was at Mount Lebanon’s Fine Arts Theater and it was a full day with 17 participants.  We heard from violin, viola, flute, piano, marimba, vibraphone, double bass and oboe!  Not to mention the power and magic of the human voice with our men and women vocalists.

  Our judges were professors Sari Gruber (vocal judge) from CMU and Andy Sledge (instrumental judge) from West Virginia University.  Each participant had 15 minutes to complete pieces of music from the baroque, classical, romantic and 20th century/contemporary periods.  So much talent made picking the winners a challenge!  A celebratory dinner for winners was held the same day at the Doubletree in Greentree.

  We are actively planning next year’s competition date and prizes, which will be announced.  We will be accepting applications beginning September 2025.
